# University-Final-Year-Project
My final year project at AUT University for 2015. Worked with 2 other members, kept here for reference.

The "Drone" class consists of the main program.

Feel free to ignore the other classes within the package, those were used for testing purposes.

For the "Drone" class to not generate errors, you must include the Bluecove library in the 
Java Build Path,

TO DO THIS,

// Right Click on Drone Simulator Project
// Click Properties
// Click Java Build Path
// Click on the Libraries tab
// Click Add Library or double click on the Bluecove library if its already present in the window
// Navigate to the directory where Bluecove library is stored
// Once found, click Ok

//To check if the correct drivers are present
//Connect up the Bluetooth adapter 
//Navigate to the device manager
//Click on the Bluetooth Radio tab
//There should be two Bluetooth drivers  - Generic Bluetooth Radio
									     - Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator
//The PC's in ws220 work perfectly with the adapter if you need to test out the program
